##Build a Travel Weather Planner
##For this lab, you will use conditional statements to determine whether commuting is possible based on the weather, the distance to travel, and the availability of a vehicle.

##Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

##You should create the following variables:
##distance_mi (a number representing the distance to travel in miles)
##is_raining (a boolean representing if the user is currently experiencing rainy weather)
#has_bike (a boolean representing if the user has a bicycle)
#has_car (a boolean representing if the user has a car)
#has_ride_share_app (a boolean representing if the user has an app that allows them to request a ride)
#You should use conditional statements to determine whether commuting is possible based on the values of these variables.
#You should use if, elif, and else statements to evaluate the distance categories in ascending order.
#If distance_mi is a falsy value:
#You should print False.
#If the distance is less than or equal to 1 mile:
#You should print True only if it is not raining.
#Otherwise, you should print False.
#If the distance is greater than 1 mile and less than or equal to 6 miles:
#You should print True only if the person has a bike and it is not raining.
#Otherwise, you should print False.
#If the distance is greater than 6 miles:
#You should print True if the person has a car or has a ride-share app.
#Otherwise, you should print False.
distance_mi = 4
is_raining = True
has_bike = False
has_car = True
has_ride_share_app = False

if not distance_mi:
    print(False)

elif distance_mi <= 1:
    if not is_raining:
        print(True)
    else:
        print(False)

elif distance_mi <= 6:
    if has_bike and not is_raining:
        print(True)
    else:
        print(False)

else:
    if has_car or has_ride_share_app:
        print(True)
    else:
        print(False)
